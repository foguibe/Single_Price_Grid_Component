# Project Readme

## Single Price Grid Component

This project is a responsive web page that showcases a "Single Price Grid Component." It is built using HTML and CSS and demonstrates various front-end development skills and best practices. Below, you'll find a detailed breakdown of the skills and techniques demonstrated in this project.

### HTML Structure

The `index.html` file provides the structure and content of the web page. Here's an overview of the HTML components used:

1. **Document Structure**: The HTML document is properly structured with the `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements.

2. **Meta Tags**: The use of meta tags, including specifying the character set and viewport settings, ensures proper rendering and responsive behavior across devices.

3. **External Stylesheet Link**: An external CSS file is linked using `<link rel="stylesheet">` to separate content from presentation.

4. **Google Fonts Import**: The project imports a Google Font, 'Ubuntu,' to style text.

5. **Main Container**: The content is structured within a main container using `div` elements, following a logical flow of information.

6. **Styling and Formatting**: HTML elements, such as headings, paragraphs, and buttons, are used to structure and format the content effectively.

7. **Accessibility**: Appropriate `alt` attributes for images and semantic HTML elements are used for accessibility.

8. **Responsive Design**: The project's HTML structure allows for a responsive layout by adapting to various screen sizes.

### CSS Styling

The `styles.css` file contains CSS rules that style the web page, adhering to modern web design best practices. It showcases the following skills:

1. **Box Sizing**: The universal selector (`*`) is used to set `box-sizing` to `border-box`, ensuring consistent box models.

2. **Margin Reset**: Default margins are reset to zero, preventing unexpected spacing between elements.

3. **Typographic Enhancements**: The project includes adjustments to typography, such as font size, weight, and color.

4. **Media Defaults**: Images are configured to be responsive and maintain their aspect ratios.

5. **Form Styling**: The project ensures that the button element is styled for a consistent appearance.

6. **Flexbox Layout**: The main content container uses Flexbox for responsive and centered alignment.

7. **Background Colors**: Proper background colors are applied to differentiate content sections.

8. **Responsive Design**: A media query is implemented to adjust the layout for screens wider than 700px.

### Specific Styles

- The `font-family` is set to 'Ubuntu' for the entire page.
- The background color is specified using HSL, ensuring a visually pleasing design.
- Margin and padding are adjusted for proper spacing and alignment.
- Text styles are tailored, including headings and paragraphs.
- Buttons are styled with background colors, font styles, and hover effects for interactivity.
